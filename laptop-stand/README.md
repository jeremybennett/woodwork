# Wooden laptop stand

A stand to hold a laptop open to nearly 180 degrees and elevated, so it can be
used as a second screen alongside a main screen.

## Parts

All parts are provided as OpenSCAD 3D models, with dimensions in
millimetres.  This is a generic design, so adjust dimensions according to the
materials available, the laptop to be supported and the height required.

### Non-wood parts

**Hinges**

These don't have to be brass, but avoid plain steel, because it will
tarnish. Bright Zinc Plated (BZP) is a cheaper alternative, or you could use
stainless steel (expensive).

* Brass hinges 1.5" x 7/8" (38mm x 22mm) (2 off)

**Screws**

- 3 x 16mm (12 off) - to fix hinges
- 3.5 x 20mm (5 off) - to fix laptop ledge to back board
- 4 x 20mm (4 off) - to fix back board to slotted support
- 4 x 25mm (4 off) - to fix base board to base support
- 4 x 30mm (10 off) - to fix base board to side and back
- 4 x 40mm (2 off) - to fix sides to back

**Nuts, bolts and washers**

These also don't have to be brass, but avoid plain steel, because it will
tarnish. Bright Zinc Plated (BZP) is a cheaper alternative, or you could use
stainless steel (expensive).

You don't need to have wing nuts, but it avoids needing a spanner to adjust
the angle. I wasn't able to source the larger form C brass washers, but they
would be better if you can get them.

- M6 x 40mm hex head brass machine screws (4 off)
- M6 brass washers (8 off) - form C if available, but form A is OK
- M6 brass hex nuts (2 off)
- M6 brass wing nuts (2 off)
